# Chemistry on Qubits
__These is just my personal notebook with  my pure notes and thoughts while I learn and apply. I hope my notes are useful to those who are stuck in the same places as me. Feel free to use it on your own responsibility!__

These Github Repository is an addition to  https://www.notion.so/Chemistry-on-Qubits-bdf3f2a8f4ab4eeaa51a7ed16ded4d7c.



### Notes chart..
Knowledge marks the treasure  !
<ul>
  <li>🚘Road: A quick walk through math to better understand Molecular Hamiltonian.</li>
  <li>💥 Matchgate: An attempt to understand the math behind Matchgates so I can use them further.</li>
  <li>🧱Basis sets: Before moving on to the code we have to calculate the integrals. I need to understand the orbitals better.</li>
  <li>📰Articles: Interesting papers related to VQE, quantum chemistry but also quantum computing in pharma.</li>
  <li>🥄Resources: Useful Links.</li>
  <li>🌲Forest : A view from the sky on the concepts encountered.(VQE, Hartree-Fock, etc.)</li>
  <li>🐙 (Github) Hello... : An introduction to something better follow the original tutorial .</li>
  <li>🐙 (Github) Playground\...MudGround.ipynnb: Dirty but useful code to explore and understand notions.</li>
  <li>🐙 (Github) Playground\...tools.py: Useful functions from Mud... files . </li>
